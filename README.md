# It is waya, It was waya.

**Again, maybe they are programming.**

I am currently working for a company and developing various projects as a hobby.  
Most recently, I have been working on vehicle pack maintenance for RealTrainMod (RTM) and developing mods for RTM.  
I would like to create the games I created when I was a student again someday, but I have not started yet.

My belonging team: [Kotatsu-RTM](https://github.com/Kotatsu-RTM/), [Team-Smile_waya](https://github.com/team-morumotto/)
